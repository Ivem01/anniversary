    <div>
      <p>It all started on hsuhsu's birthday... something that I thought would never happen.</p>
      <p>The day that I could never forget: <strong>Oct 30, 2023</strong></p>
      <p>You smiled at me, and my world felt softer.</p>
      <p>You talked to me, and my whole world got quiet.</p>
      <p>Your sweet voice got me wanting to keep hearing it. I didn't want you to stop talking.</p>
      <p>I felt butterflies in every part of me.</p>
      <p>We shared our first laugh, and I knew I wanted to hear it forever.</p>
      <p>We shared our first hug, and I felt like I was home.</p>
      <p>I wanted to become closer to you.</p>
      <p>I never thought that I would fall in love with a girl.</p>
      <p>I had many doubts but nothing else other than the word, "love" could explain the emotions that you made me feel.</p>
      <p>At that moment, I realized and said to myself, "so this is love".</p>
